Answer:
What is the average rating for each genre?


Exploring nationality and gender of actors
For each movie in the database, the three most important actors are identified and listed in the table actors. This table includes the nationality and gender of the actors. We are interested in how much diversity there is in the nationalities of the actors and how many actors and actresses are in the list.

Instructions
100 XP
Count the number of actors in the table actors from each country, the number of male and female actors and the total number of actors.

SELECT 
	nationality, -- Select nationality of the actors
    gender, -- Select gender of the actors
    COUNT(*) -- Count the number of actors
FROM actors
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((nationality), (gender), ()); -- Use the correct GROUPING SETS operation


Exploring rating by country and gender
Now you will investigate the average rating of customers aggregated by country and gender.

Select the columns country, gender, and rating and use the correct join to combine the table renting with customer.

SELECT 
	c.country, -- Select country, gender and rating
	c.gender,
	r.rating
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN customers AS c -- Use the correct join
ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id;




Use GROUP BY to calculate the average rating over country and gender. Order the table by country and gender.


SELECT 
	c.country, 
    c.gender,
	avg(rating) -- Calculate average rating
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN customers AS c
ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY country , gender -- Order and group by country and gender
ORDER BY country,gender;


Now, use GROUPING SETS to get the same result, i.e. the average rating over country and gender.


SELECT 
	c.country, 
    c.gender,
	AVG(r.rating)
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN customers AS c
ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((country, gender)); -- Group by country and gender with GROUPING SETS



Report all information that is included in a pivot table for country and gender in one SQL table.


SELECT 
	c.country, 
    c.gender,
	AVG(r.rating)
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN customers AS c
ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id
-- Report all info from a Pivot table for country and gender
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((country, gender), (country), (gender), ());

For each genre, calculate the average rating (use the alias avg_rating), the number of ratings (use the alias n_rating), the number of movie rentals (use the alias n_rentals), and the number of distinct movies (use the alias n_movies).

SELECT m.genre, -- For each genre, calculate:
